**API Design**

**ACL** - access-control list. Refer to a permissioning model: which users in a system can perform which operations (like delete, edit, view etc).

Tweaking API after it has been launched to the public is very difficult.

Swagger format: format to describe APIs (image). Like give even path to every endpoint. It’s counterpart of plain .txt explanation
