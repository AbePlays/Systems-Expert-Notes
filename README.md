<h2>Synopses of the SystemsExpert</h2>

In this repo you can find memos that I made for every topic covered on https://www.algoexpert.io/systems/product <br>

<ul>
  <li>In <ins><i>.md</i></ins> files you can find synopses themselves</li>
  <li>Also, there are screenshots attached to the notes</li>
  <li>If you want to see bare screeenshots, then go to <ins><i>ImageRepo</i></ins></li>
 </ul>

- synposes are paginated in order topic was covered on the syte, <br>
  hence for better coverage stick to the order
