**Storage**

**Database** is a server. 

**Persistence** of data in a database. If there is a db server, this db can write data to Disk (SSD or HDD) & Memory(RAM). If written to the former -> persist even if computer crashes, but if written to Memory and server/computer crashes -> no data any more.

<i>However, reading & writing data to memory is much faster rather than from & to disk</i>

**Note:** HDD - hard-disk drive; SSD - solid-state drive
SSD is more expensive rather than HDD, hence used in cases when data must be frequently accessed and updated whilst HDD in cases when data isnâ€™t really often used.
