# Storage

A **Database** is an organized collection of data, so that it can be easily accessed and managed.

**Persistence** of data in a database. If there is a db server, this db can write data to Disk (SSD or HDD) or to Memory(RAM). If written to the former, the data is persisted even if the machine crashes, but if written to memory and server/machine crashes, the data is lost.

> However, reading & writing data to memory is much faster rather than from & to disk

**Note:** HDD - hard-disk drive; SSD - solid-state drive
SSD is more expensive than HDD, hence they used in cases when data must be frequently accessed and updated whilst HDDs are used in cases where data isnâ€™t required very often.
